## Local Builds

To build Grid locally, first you must install the prerequisites outlined in the
[README](https://github.com/splintercommunity/grid/blob/main/README.md). Then run
`cargo build` from the root directory. This command builds all of the Grid
components, including `gridd` (the grid daemon), the CLI, and all of the smart
contracts in the `contracts` directory.

To build individual components, run `cargo build` in the component directories.
For example, to build only `grid-cli`, navigate to `cli`, then run
`cargo build`.

## Docker Builds

To build Grid using Docker, run `docker-compose build` from the root directory.
This command builds Docker images for all of the Grid components, including
`gridd` (the grid daemon), the CLI, and all of the smart contracts in the
`contracts` directory.

To build individual components using Docker, run
`docker-compose build <component>` from the root directory. For example, to
build only `grid-cli`, run `docker-compose build grid-cli`.

To use Docker to build Grid with experimental features enabled, set an
enviroment variable in your shell before running the build commands. For
example: `export 'CARGO_ARGS=-- --features experimental'`. To go back to
building with default features, unset the evironment variable:
`unset CARGO_ARGS`

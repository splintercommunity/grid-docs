Grid supports [Splinter](https://www.splinter.dev/) as a backend
distributed ledger. This document shows how to set up a Grid-on-Splinter
environment that runs in a set of Docker containers.

The example Splinter docker-compose file creates a network with three nodes
(alpha, beta, and gamma) that can be used for demos or application development.
This environment includes the Pike, Product, Location, Purchase Order, and
Schema smart contracts.

- [Pike]({% link docs/0.3/grid_pike.md %}) handles organization and identity
  permissions with Sabre, a smart contract engine that is included in the
  Splinter scabbard service.
- [Grid Product]({% link docs/0.3/grid_product.md %})
  provides a way to share GS1-compatible product data (items
  that are transacted, traded, or referenced in a supply chain).
  [Location]({% link docs/0.3/grid_location.md %}) is a framework for sharing
  location master data between trade partners.
- [Purchase Order]({% link docs/0.3/grid_purchase_order.md %}) enables buyers
  and sellers to automate and synchronize their purchase order processes and
  data. It encapsulates purchase order contract information, workflows, and
  permissions to provide business partners with a current and complete view
  of their shared purchase order processes at all times.
- [Schema]({% link docs/0.3/schema_smart_contract_specification.md %})
  provides a reusable, standard approach to defining, storing, and
  consuming the product properties. Property definitions are collected into a
  Schema data type that defines all the possible properties for an item.


## Prerequisites

- Docker Engine
- Docker Compose


## Important Notes

Due to ongoing development of Splinter the images in this example can become
stale. If you have used this procedure before, run the following command to
ensure that your images are up to date:

```
$ docker-compose -f examples/splinter/docker-compose.yaml pull generate-registry db-alpha scabbard-cli-alpha splinterd-alpha
```

## Setting Up and Running Grid

1. Clone the [Grid repository](https://github.com/splintercommunity/grid)
   ([https://github.com/splintercommunity/grid](https://github.com/splintercommunity/grid)).
2. Navigate to the grid root directory and build the Grid Docker containers.

   `$ docker-compose -f examples/splinter/docker-compose.yaml build --pull`

3. Start the Grid Docker containers.

   `$ docker-compose -f examples/splinter/docker-compose.yaml up`

   This docker-compose file creates a network with two nodes (alpha and beta)
   that includes the Pike, Schema, Location, Purchase Order, and Product smart
   contracts.

## Next Steps

Once the Grid on Splinter environment is running, you can create a circuit to
connect two nodes, then demonstrate Grid functionality with existing smart
contracts, such as Pike organizations, Grid products and Grid Purchase Order.
You can also upload new smart contracts to the circuit.

### Creating a Circuit

[Creating Splinter
Circuits]({% link docs/0.4/creating_splinter_circuits.md %})
explains the procedure to connect nodes on a circuit.

Tip: After the circuit exists, you can [demonstrate circuit
scope](#demonstrate-circuit-scope) to show that Splinter isolates information
to members of a circuit.

For more information on Splinter circuits, see the
[Splinter documentation](https://www.splinter.dev/docs/).

### Demonstrating Grid Smart Contract Functionality

You can use the Pike, Grid Product, and Grid Schema smart contracts to
demonstrate Grid functionality by creating an organization and agent, defining
a schema for the product properties, and creating a product. Similarly, you can
demonstrate functionality with Pike and Grid Purchase Order.

* [Creating Organizations]({% link docs/0.3/using_pike.md %})
  describes how to create an owning organization for Grid items (such as
  products), and set the permissions for an agent who is
  allowed to create and manage those items.

* [Creating Schemas]({% link docs/0.3/creating_schemas.md %})
  explains how to define the format of properties for Grid items such as
  products.

* [Creating Products]({% link docs/0.3/creating_products.md %}) shows how to
  create, update, and delete products as the organization's agent.

* [Creating Purchase Orders]({% link docs/0.3/using_purchase_order.md %}) shows
  how to create and update purchase orders and versions and manage them between
  organizations.


### Demonstrating Smart Contract Deployment

You can use the `scabbard` CLI to deploy custom smart contracts on existing
circuits.

* [Uploading Smart Contracts]({% link docs/0.3/uploading_smart_contracts.md %})
  explains how to upload and configure a new smart contract.


### Demonstrating Circuit Scope

If a node is not a part of a circuit, that node cannot access information about
that circuit or any transactions that occur on that circuit.

Use the following steps to demonstrate that the third node in the network
(gamma-node-000) cannot see the circuit between alpha and beta, even when it
participates in a new multi-party circuit with those nodes.

1. Connect to the splinterd-gamma Docker container. You will use this container
   to run Splinter commands on gamma-node-000.

   ```
   $ docker exec -it splinterd-gamma bash
   root@splinterd-gamma:/#
   ```

2. Verify that splinterd-gamma does not see any circuits.
   ```
   root@splinterd-gamma:/# splinter circuit list --url http://splinterd-gamma:8085
   ID MANAGEMENT MEMBERS
   ```

## Privacy Enforcement

Splinter strictly enforces privacy for all information on a circuit, including
participants, available smart contracts, and transactions performed by the
participants using those smart contracts.

For example, if gamma creates a circuit with alpha and a separate circuit with
beta, then creates purchase orders with both alpha and beta, the `grid po list`
command on gamma will show only the gamma-alpha purchase orders while on the
gamma-alpha circuit. Even though gamma-alpha and gamma-beta circuits are using
the same Grid Purchase Order smart contract, their data (smart contract
transactions) remain private to their two-party circuits.

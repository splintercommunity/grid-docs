# Product Sapling

The [grid repository](https://github.com/splintercommunity/grid/tree/main/ui)
includes the UI for Grid functionality. This document shows some planned
screens for the Product functionality to be added to the Grid UI.

NOTE: This planning document shows preliminary images for the Grid Product
sapling. The actual interface will change as the UI is developed.

## Product List

This is the default page that a user will see after navigating to the Product
sapling.

![]({% link community/images/ProductList.svg %} "Product List")

## Product Creation Form

Clicking the "Create Product" button will bring up this form.

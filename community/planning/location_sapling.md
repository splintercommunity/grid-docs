# Location Sapling

The [grid repository](https://github.com/splintercommunity/grid/tree/main/ui)
repository includes the UI for Grid functionality. This document shows some
planned screens for the Location functionality to be added to the Grid UI.

NOTE: This planning document shows preliminary images for the Grid Location
sapling. The actual interface will change as the UI is developed.

## Location Table

This is the default page that a user will see after navigating to the Location
sapling.

## Location Creation Form

Clicking the "New Location" button will bring up this form.

## Overview

The **DLT Event Monitor** is a utility that updates pending batches in Grid
with the latest information from the DLT. It does this by subscribing to the
DLTâ€™s subscription endpoint.

This is useful for two primary purposes:

 - Tracking whether the batch submitter needs to resubmit a batch
 - Allowing someone who submits a batch to be notified of the current batch
   status

## Input / Output Definition

The DLT polling monitor uses the following inputs:

 - `subscribe_stream` - Normalized stream sourced from Splinter or Sawtooth
 - `rate_limit` - Maximum rate at which polls can occur, as a Duration

And it modifies with the following:

 - `poll_batch_statuses` - Make a request to get the latest batch statuses.
   This will likely be handled through the [DLT Polling
   Monitor](dlt_polling_monitor.md).

## Strategy

The DLT event monitor connects to the `subscribe_stream` via websocket. When a
transaction is received, we can be reasonably certain that a batch has
completed. We then notify the DLT Polling monitor via `poll_batch_statuses`.
The DLT polling monitor then has the opportunity to immediately poll. Events
are rate limited at the `rate_limit`.

### Known limitations

This solution does not provide a method to determine whether a specific
transaction has occurred or failed in real time. The `subscribe_stream` will
only send events that are successful, and not send any accompanying batch
information. This info will need to come in via the [DLT Polling
Monitor](dlt_polling_monitor.md).

Ideally the DLT streams for Sawtooth and Splinter would be expanded to a more
generalized stream that includes not only raw ledger updates, but batch
execution information.
